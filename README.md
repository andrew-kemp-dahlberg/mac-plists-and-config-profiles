com.macjutsu.super.plist assists with MacOS updates. I have added a plist that I have found useful. It will have a soft deadline of 5 deferrals for scheduling before you can't remove the window and a hard deadline of 5 days after which updates will automatically deploy

com.apple.applicationaccess defers major OS updates for 14 days so we have time to thoroughly test.
